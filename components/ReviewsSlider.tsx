I have had 3 treatments with her and not only am I impressed with results I am also hugely impressed with the entire process and experience.\nI only wanted to have facial treatments from a doctor, Dr Sha is so qualified and will alay any fears you may have whilst also acknowledging potential side effects. She is able to look at a face know exactly which small tweaks will give you that rested and rejuvenated look within an immaculate clinic.\nI have had botox on my forehead, naso-labial filler and 0.5 lip filler of 2 seperate appointments and although I was not after compliments from other people I have had so many comments about how young/ welI look! Yet the results Dr Sha acheives are natural and subtle- nobody has asked me if I have had a specific treatment done.\nThis is your face- spend that bit extra and get top products adminsitered by someone who is at the top of their game you will not be disappointed!",

Sha made me feel completely at ease. She explained the entire process clearly, answered all my questions, and gave me excellent aftercare instructions.\nThe treatment itself was smooth and comfortable, and I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin tone and pigmentation. My skin looks much brighter, clearer, and more even now. I truly appreciate the team’s expertise and care throughout the journey.\nThank you, M Sha Aesthetic Clinic, for helping me achieve such beautiful results! I highly recommend this clinic to anyone considering Cosmelan or other aesthetic treatments.",
